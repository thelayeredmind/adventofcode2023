This is my attempt at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
I am doing this to learn [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), learn to implement algorithms with functional programming,
and write GUIs in the process to improve interactivity for the puzzles.

## Installation

Download elm, and then in the repo's directory enter

```bash
elm reactor
```

Follow the instructions from the prompt.
